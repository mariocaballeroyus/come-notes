[[Theory of Plates]]
- Free edges: trajectory **perpendicular** to edge ($\tau_{xy} = 0$). 
- Loaded edge: trajectory in direction of loading.
- Trajectories are perpendicular to each other.
- Along a trajectory, stress may change from tension to compression.

## Load carrying behavior

In plane stress/strain plates, the stress distribution is dominated by local effects near the bearing zones (principle of St. Venant).
