***`Previous`***: [[Convergence and Sequences]]

**Definition** (`Cauchy sequence`). Let $V$ be a normed space. A sequence $(u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subset V$ is called a *Cauchy sequence* if
$$
\lim_{m,n \to \infty}{||u_m-u_n||} = 0
$$
Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, but not every Cauchy sequence is convergent, for the reason that, although the members may be converging to a limit, not be part of the space.

**Definition** (`complete space`). Let $V$ be a normed space. We call $V$ a *complete space* if every sequence in $V$ converges to an element in $V$.

**Definition** (`Banach space`). A complete normed space is called a *Banach space*. 

**Definition** (`Hilbert space`). A complete inner product space is called a *Hilbert Space*. 

Since every inner product defined a norm, every Hilbert space is a Banach space.
